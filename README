Lingua-AR-Db version 1.51
======================

This is the DB management of a dictionary from Arabic to another language:
for every word coming from the input file, we save it under the file called as its stem.


All the vocabulary databases are located in a particular folder, so that these files may be directly modified without any harm to the script execution.
Filenames will begin with a '%', followed by the ArabTeX translitteration of the stem.


Moreover I'm working on an importation module, so that new stems/terms may be added easily and quickly to the local database.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires module Lingua::AR::Word >=1.5 and Perl >=5.8.1


MODULES

Lingua::AR::Db
	this is the class for the DB object, so that we may access multiple translations (aka "translations in several languages") by accessing various DB objects, each of them working of a different folder.


NOTES

->Everything (script code and data) works ONLY if raw data is encoded in Unicode (utf8 or UTF-8). Other representations will lead to errors or wrong results.
->Please use non-formatted text as input data.
Using Microsoft Word .doc files, Adobe .pdf or HTML pages WILL cause problems.
->Every database name begins with a '%' so that it isn't hidden by the shell in case it begins with a period.
->The syntax for vocabulary database is the following:

"\t arabic-stem

arabic name\t italian translation"

where '\t' means TAB (tabulation, NOT sum of whitespaces)
->The syntax for files to be imported is the following:

"Italian_name = Arabic_name"
